## Aim

In this study, we investigate the primary factors that influence the cost of homes in Beijing. By analyzing data from Lianjia.com, we explore how the location of a property and the timing of its sale affect its price. This research aims to shed light on the complex dynamics of Beijing's real estate market and provide a clearer picture for individuals looking to understand the value of real estate in this bustling metropolis.

Given the rapid urbanization and rising housing costs in China, understanding the factors that drive housing prices is of crucial importance. By examining how public attention, as reflected through web search behaviors, influences the spatial dynamics of housing prices, we can provide novel insights that complement traditional real estate research, which often relies on transactional data alone. 

## Background

The housing market in China has undergone significant changes in recent years, characterized by rapid urbanization and escalating housing costs. This has led to a growing body of literature on real estate price modeling, spatial analysis, and the incorporation of digital data sources, such as web search trends, to better understand consumer behavior and market dynamics. Our study situates itself within this broader context, seeking to contribute to the existing knowledge on the factors that shape housing prices in the Chinese context.

## Data

Housing price of Beijing from the
[Kaggle: Housing price of Beijing from 2011 to 2017](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruiqurm/lianjia) 

## Method

The R programming language (R Core Team, 2019) 
and the following R packages were used to perform the analysis: 
knitr (Xie 2014), tidyverse (Wickham 2017), and Quarto (Allaire et al 2022). 

To examine the relationship between public attention and housing prices in Chinese cities, we employ a time series analysis and linear regression modeling approach, complemented by spatial analysis using the ggmap package. This methodological framework has been widely used in real estate price research and allows us to capture the spatial and temporal dynamics of the housing market.

In our analysis, we utilize web search data as a proxy for public attention, recognizing that this data source may be subject to certain biases. To address this, we supplement our time series and linear regression models with spatial analysis techniques enabled by the ggmap package. This allows us to visualize the geographic patterns of housing prices and explore the spatial relationships between public attention and price variations across different regions.

## Data Analysis

The dataset from Lianjia.com was loaded and inspected for structure and summary statistics. Initial data exploration included reviewing the distributions of key variables such as square footage and price.

Data cleaning processes involved removing irrelevant columns, converting character variables to their appropriate types, and handling missing values. We also removed variables with non-ASCII characters to streamline the dataset for analysis.

Further exploratory data analysis revealed insights into the relationships between various features of the properties and their prices. For example, histograms were used to visualize the distribution of total prices, while scatter plots helped in understanding the relationship between the square footage of properties and their total prices.

Correlation matrices were computed and visualized to identify potential linear relationships between numerical variables, informing subsequent modeling choices.

## Visualisation

![Total housing Price of Whether Having Elevator](../results/figure/plot_4_price_distribution_elevator.png){#fig-elevator-distribution}

The value of property features was illustrated in @fig-subway-distribution and @fig-elevator-distribution through box plots comparing total prices based on the presence of subways and elevators. The premium for these features was clearly visible, reflecting the higher prices consumers are willing to pay for added convenience.


![Prices in Function of The Renovation Condition](../results/figure/plot_5_renovation_condition.png){#fig-renovation-condition}

@fig-renovation-condition delved into the impact of renovation conditions on property values. Through the variance illustrated in the box plots for each condition category, we observed a correlation between renovation quality and pricing, indicating that buyers are inclined to invest more in well-maintained properties.


![Monthly Average Residential Sale Price](../results/figure/plot_6_monthly_price_overview.png){#fig-monthly-price}

The market's temporal dynamics were captured in @fig-monthly-price, a time series plot that traced the trajectory of average monthly residential sale prices, with the volume of transactions visually represented by the size of the points. This plot served as an indicator of market trends and economic factors affecting housing prices over time.

![Map with Housing Price](../results/figure/plot_8_beijing_map_with_price_overlay.png){#fig-beijing-map-with-price}

Geospatial distribution and its influence on property values were elucidated through @fig-beijing-map and @fig-beijing-map-with-price. A base map of Beijing provided the context for a subsequent overlay of price data, revealing distinct high and low-value areas across the cityscape.


![District-wise Housing Price Distribution](../results/figure/plot_9_boxplot_price_district.png){#fig-district-wise-housing-price}

@fig-district-wise-housing-price presented a detailed district-wise analysis, comparing housing prices across Beijing's various districts through box plots. This granular view highlighted the real estate disparities influenced by district-specific characteristics.


![Beijing Map with District Overlay](../results/figure/plot_10_beijing_map_with_district_overlay.png){#fig-beijing-map-with-district}

Finally, @fig-beijing-map-with-district combined geographic and price data by color-coding each district on a map of Beijing, offering an at-a-glance comparison of real estate valuation across different urban areas.

Our linear regression model, developed after the exploratory analysis, utilized these processed and visualized data to predict total property prices. The model's efficacy was visually assessed by overlaying actual versus predicted prices on a scatter plot, which served as a testament to the model’s predictive capabilities. The careful curation and analysis of the dataset provided insights into the market drivers for housing prices in Beijing, which could aid stakeholders in making data-driven decisions.

![Prediction Model](../results/price_prediction_plot.png){#fig-prediction-model}

@tbl-model is the statistical summary of our linear regression model, which is built to predict house prices in Beijing, with the response variable totalPrice and various explanatory variables. The model excludes constructionTime and buildingType from the analysis.

The model has a high Multiple R-squared value of 0.8831, indicating a strong fit to the data.

@fig-prediction-model compares actual price and predicted total prices from the model, with a red line representing perfect prediction. Points close to this line are predictions that match closely with actual prices, whereas points further away represent less accurate predictions. @fig-prediction-model shows a strong positive correlation, but with a certain degree of variance as prices increase, suggesting that while the model predicts lower-priced houses quite accurately, it is less precise with higher-priced ones.

The present study employed a linear regression model to conduct an in-depth analysis of the key determinants of housing prices in the Beijing real estate market. The model exhibits a strong overall fit, with an R-squared of 0.8821, indicating that it is able to explain approximately 88.21% of the variation in housing prices. The F-statistic of 65,750 with a p-value less than 2.2e-16 suggests that the model is highly statistically significant. Examining the coefficient estimates, several key findings emerge. First, locational factors play a significant role in shaping housing prices. The model indicates that prices tend to decrease as the longitude (i.e., eastward location) increases and increase as the latitude (i.e., northward location) rises.

Second, the time-related variables show interesting patterns. The number of days the property has been on the market (trade time) has a positive and highly significant association with prices, suggesting that properties that have been listed for longer tend to command higher prices, all else equal. The number of followers a property has is also positively related to prices, though the effect size is relatively small.

Regarding the physical property characteristics, the results are consistent with standard hedonic pricing theory. Larger living area, more kitchens, and more bathrooms are associated with higher prices. Interestingly, the number of living rooms and drawing rooms have negative impacts on prices, potentially indicating a preference for more functional living spaces in this market.

The building structure and renovation condition also matter. Properties with brick/wood construction tend to have lower prices compared to other building types, while homes with steel/concrete structures command higher prices. The condition of renovations also plays a role, with rough and simplistic renovations associated with lower prices relative to more extensive renovations. In terms of accessibility and ownership factors, the model reveals that properties without elevators have higher prices, potentially due to lower construction costs. Homes not located near a subway station also tend to have higher prices. However, the length of property ownership does not appear to have a significant effect on prices.

Lastly, the model identifies substantial spatial variation in housing prices across different districts in Beijing. Several districts, such as Chaoyang, Daxing, Fangshan, and Tongzhou, have significantly higher prices compared to the baseline, while the Xicheng district has lower prices. Additionally, the average price in the surrounding community is a strong positive predictor of individual property prices, highlighting the importance of local market conditions and amenities.
Overall, this comprehensive regression analysis provides rich statistical evidence to deepen the understanding of the price formation mechanisms in the Beijing real estate market. While the linear framework has achieved good explanatory power, there may still be some heterogeneity and non-linear effects that warrant further exploration. Future research could experiment with more complex modeling approaches to further enhance the predictive accuracy and provide more precise insights to inform relevant decision-making.
