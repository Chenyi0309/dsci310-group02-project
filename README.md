## Project Overview

In this study, we investigate the primary factors that influence the cost of homes in Beijing. By analyzing data from Lianjia.com, we explore how the location of a property and the timing of its sale affect its price. This research aims to shed light on the complex dynamics of Beijing's real estate market and provide a clearer picture for individuals looking to understand the value of real estate in this bustling metropolis.

## Introduction

The real estate market of Beijing is as dynamic as it is diverse, presenting a unique opportunity to study the various factors influencing housing prices. This study aims to pinpoint the most significant determinants, with a special focus on the effects of location and time.

To explore this, we have sourced data from the Lianjia.com, which records extensive property transaction details in Beijing. Our research question investigates how location and the time of sale relate to the price of housing.

Through this report, we will analyze the ‘Housing price in Beijing’ dataset to uncover patterns and relationships within the housing market, offering a student's perspective on the data and what it reveals about property values in Beijing.
