# DSCI 310 Group Contract
## Group 02

### Expectation

Everyone will be responsible for a part of the group project and they will be expected to compete on time so that the group can stay on track of assignments. We expect equal contributions from all members so that the final project is a fair representation of each member’s work.

We plan to work together respectfully, both inside and outside of class. This includes actively listening to others’ opinions and considering all members’ ideas when making a decision. The project will be written in R.

Through this project, we would like to practice our theoretical skills learned in the lecture and apply them to a real-life example.

### Meetings

Meetings will be held online. 

All members are expected to attend the meetings. If a member cannot make a meeting, written notice must be given 24 hours before the meeting to discuss alternative options. 

We can meet within 48 hours of the deadline and discuss what needs to be modified.


### Communication

Communication will be key within our group and thus, we expect that everyone will stay in touch and continuously check for messages from other group members. 

Be respectful in the communication. Communicate project progress promptly. Check the Instagram group chats every day.

In the event of a group member going missing, we will first attempt to contact them over
Instagram. If they do not respond past the 24-hour limit and a hard deadline is approaching, we will split their remaining tasks amongst the rest of the group members and inform
a TA of this change in responsibility.

### Review/Quality Check

All members are expected to submit a pull request for their work on the repository for the group project on Github.com. 

Feedback to other groupmates must be constructive and received with an open mind. Negative and or harmful comments will not be tolerated and will be reported to either the TAs or the instructors.

Members are expected to add teammates as reviewers to have all pull requests reviewed by another teammate. Pull requests should be reviewed within 24 hours after creation.

### Task Assignments/Deadline

Task Assignments should be completed one day before the deadline. 
Teammates need to review the work before the deadline to ensure that the final version is ready for submission and create the required version tag.

### Breach of Contact

Failure to follow the team contract will result in a three-step warning system:
The first step is a written Instagram notice that outlines the violation of the team contract and a reminder of the team contract conditions.
The second step is a meeting to discuss the behavior and write an agreement to follow the team contract required by the members.
The third step is to reach out to the lab instructor or TAs about the issues with the teammate
